    <p>Studies suggest that many children in out-of-home care have experienced some form of sexual abuse. Often foster and adoptive parents are not adequately prepared for the disruptive behaviors of sexually abused children, nor are they prepared to address the child&#8217;s disclosure of earlier sexual abuse. 
        This 12-meeting in-service training program helps foster and adoptive parents develop the skills necessary to respond to the double trauma that children experience from being sexually abused and removed from their birth families. Leaders will learn how to create a safe and constructive training environment where sensitive issues can be discussed openly.
    </p>
    <p>The first 5 &#8220;meetings&#8221; of the program are the &#8220;Core&#8221; meetings which are designed to meet the basic 
        needs of foster/adoptive parents in understanding and meeting the needs of children who have been sexually abused.</p>
    <p>The additional 7 meetings are &#8220;optional&#8221; meetings which are designed to meet the advanced needs of children who have been sexually abused</p>

    <h4>How to Use CSA/MAPP:</h4>
    <p>The first five &#8220;core&#8221; meetings provide basic information on child sexual abuse. 
        The remaining seven &#8220;advanced topic&#8221; meetings build on this foundation and offer a flexible design from which the parents or the agency may select in any order to most effectively meet their needs.</p>
