    <p>Caring for Our Own is an educational/group support program for relative/kinship caregivers. Through nine meetings, relative caregivers are provided with information about services and resources available, receive support from other caregivers, develop ongoing support networks, build skills to better parent the children in their homes, and learn to manage and enhance their relationship with birth parents and agencies. Leaders will learn how to effectively create and support a support group environment.</p>
