    <p>The Children&#8217;s Alliance of Kansas (CAOK) is the current national owner of the copyrighted &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of MAPP programs.  
        NYS Office of Children and Family Services (NYS OCFS)/Center for Development of Human Services (CDHS) has permission from CAOK 
        to provide MAPP programs (<em>GPSII/MAPP</em>, <em>Caring for our Own</em>, <em>Deciding Together</em>, <em>Shared Parenting</em>, 
        <em>Mini-MAPP</em> and <em>Fostering and/ or 
        Adopting the Child Who Has Been Sexually Abused</em>) to certify leaders through leader certification workshops and directly to 
        foster/adoptive parents in NY State. NYS OCFS/CDHS also has permission from CAOK to modify the MAPP curricula in order to meet 
        the specific needs of NY State agency staff and foster/adoptive parents. 
        Note that any curriculum revisions need to be submitted to the appropriate NYS OCFS Regional Office so the proposed changes 
        can be reviewed. If approved, there must be a request to CAOK for permission to incorporate adaptations of the national 
        training materials.
