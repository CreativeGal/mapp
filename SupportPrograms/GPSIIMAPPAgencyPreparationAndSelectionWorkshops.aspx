    <h3>Who should attend:</h3>

    <p>In order for a new foster care/adoption agency to receive the benefits of implementing GPSII/MAPP 
        and its adjunct MAPP programs and other MAPP support services, the agency must, first of all, 
        be an OCFS-approved foster care/adoption agency. Also, agencies are required to have assessed their willingness 
        and ability to implement the program.</p>
    <p>This includes a presentation on the conceptual framework of the GPSII Program, MAPP program adjunct services and products, the GPSII/MAPP Program tools and various assessment activities. It
is designed to provide prospective MAPP agencies with opportunities to understand the benefits of implementing GPSII/MAPP at their agencies. Agencies have opportunities to assess their strengths/ needs in relationship to agency implementation, implementation costs, staffing and space requirements and the agency efforts that are required to successfully implement GPSII/MAPP and other MAPP programs.
