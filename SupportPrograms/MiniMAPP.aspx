    <h3>Length:</h3>
    <p>12&#8211;15 hours</p>
    <p>These trainings are delivered on-site (at agencies and local districts) and at CDHS regional offices.</p>
    <h3>Who Should Attend:</h3>
    <p>Agencies can invite foster parents who were not certified through GPSII/MAPP, designated babysitters or back-up care 
        providers of children in care, caseworkers, supervisors, administrators, support staff, 
        or anyone else who works or volunteers at the agency</p>
    <p>Mini-MAPP is a condensed overview of the 30-hour GPSII/MAPP Program. It is designed to introduce participants to the philosophy, 
        concepts, activities, terminology, and tools used in GPSII/MAPP. By offering Mini-MAPP to these participants, 
        GPSII/MAPP becomes a guiding and unifying framework that everyone can use in their partnerships with families of children 
        in care.</p>
