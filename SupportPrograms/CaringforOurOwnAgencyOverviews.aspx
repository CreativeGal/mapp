    <h3>Workshop length:</h3>
    <p>6 hours</p>
    <h3>Who should attend:</h3>
    <p>agency staff, kinship caseworkers, supervisors and agency administrators.</p>
    <p>These six-hour overviews are designed specifically to familiarize agency staff with <em>Caring for Our Own</em>, 
        a kinship/relative caregiver educational support group training program. By attending this overview, 
        agency staff will understand the benefits of the program and support/promote the program within the agency&#8217;s relative caregiver population.</p>
    <p>The Overview is also intended to promote caseworker understanding of the benefits of the <em>Caring for Our Own</em> program and, 
        as a result, to encourage relative caregivers to attend the 9-meeting <em>Caring for Our Own</em> educational support group program.</p>
